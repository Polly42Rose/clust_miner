**Abstract**

In the modern world, data is everywhere. All activities on websites, social networks, and software systems are being recorded. Analysing such data is key for improving user experience and removing deadlocks from processes. Process mining aims to build precise and compact models from event logs. 

A novel method for process discovery is proposed in this paper. We use process mining best practices together with clusterisation techniques to mine process models. Not only is trace information used in the suggested algorithm, but event attributes information is considered as well. The approach is implemented in a web application ClustMiner, which allows to upload a custom log and derive a process model.
